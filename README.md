# Polyglot Project Euler Solutions

Going through the [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) problems
and providing one or more solutions in the following languages:

* Haskell
* Erlang
* Scala

## Enviroment Setup

To be able to build and run these solutions follow the instructions
for the language of interest in question below.

### Haskell

Uses `cabal` to build Haskell code using a thin `Makefile` layer around
it. Therefore prerequisites are:

* Cabal
* make

I am also only testing and verifying the solutions with:

* [GHC 7.2.2](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_7_2_2)

### Erlang

Uses `rebar` to build Erlang code with a thin `Makefile` layer around
it. Prerequisites are:

* [Rebar](https://github.com/basho/rebar)
* make

I am also only testing and verifying the solutions with:

* [Erlang/OTP R15A](https://github.com/erlang/otp/zipball/OTP_R15A)

### Scala

Uses `sbt` to build Scala code with a thin `Makefile` layer around it.
Prerequisites are:

* [Sbt](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki)
* make

I am also only testing and verifying the solutions with:

* [Scala v2.9.1](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/10780)
